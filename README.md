I was all over the place in this project, it was the most difficult for me and I didnt full grasp it. I set up my html with links to the css and js files and then made id's for all the buttons and messages that I thought I needed. For the javascript I messed up and ended up making the quiz on the prompts, I couldnt get it to appear on the page itself. I made an array of questions and answers using the \n which means anything you put after \n will appear on the next line, it is very useful. I made a for loop to ask the prompts individually and then sends out alerts immediately after to notify the person if they were right or wrong.
